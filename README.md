# GoogleBookAPI-MVVM

Problem Statement
Using the Google Books API, we need to search books and display the “Search Results”. If the search query returns no results, then we need to show “No Results”. This is BONUS. We can achieve the search using end point "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={search term}”

Requirements
Inputs. Give the user a search box to enter the book to be searched
Outputs. Make a visual grid of books with at least thumbnail, title, and author(s) displayed. Feel free to add addition meta data and information.
MUST create a detail page that if the user clicks a book, it displays the books image, title, etc... in its own view controller.
AND this detail page, must be in the navigation's flow. AKA have a back button
AND 3 Unit Test cases must be present for the application
MUST - Create a Favorite Feature, That the user can save favorited books
